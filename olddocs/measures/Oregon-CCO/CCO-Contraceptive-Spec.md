| **Purpose** | The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, can be used for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about womenâ€™s knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Contraceptive prevalence rate is an indicator of health, population, development and women's empowerment. It also serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services that are essential for meeting many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s, especially the child mortality, maternal health HIV/AIDS, and gender related goals. |
