# Measures in Arcadia Analytics #
Welcome to measures on the Arcadia Analytics Wiki!

**[About Measure Documentation](./Measure-Documentation.md)**

Currently, the measures team maintains a blistering pace of measure development tracked across releases about every month. Measures releases are referred to as 'MRC'. 

The most recent released set of measures is MRC 1.7 in April 2016. 

Measures are organized based on their default initiatives they appear in the Arcadia Analytics base configuration. However, clients are encouraged to customize their initiatives and measure sets. 

Implementation teams may reference the [Measure Inventory](../img/MeasureInventory.xlsx) for the release numbers deployed names and plans for upcoming releases of the measures.
