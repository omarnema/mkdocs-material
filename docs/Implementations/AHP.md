##Overview


###Description
Accountable Health Partners (AHP) is an Independent Physicians Association (IPA) that is funded and supported by University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC).  Arcadia first contracted with Accountable Health Partners through the Excellus sponsored program.  The primary goal of the AHP environment is to enable AHP with the tools needed to support their IPA with a clinically coordinated network and enable them to participate in pay for performance style contracts with health plans and government programs (like ACO or DSRIP).  Most of the connectors for AHP also exist in XLCS and with few exceptions are carbon copies of their XCLS counterpart, though AHP has a limited set of Excellus claims data extracted from the XCLS environment, additional claims sources (MVP & more to come) and richer data from URMC.

##Configurations
###Periods Processed
By default the product will dynamically run the periods for the current week, month, quarter, trailing year and year.  In **QA only** all calendar years that exist in the product outside of 2013 are also calculated as part of the nightly job, which is added by this [script](https://github.com/arcadia/qdw-ahp/blob/master/Database/Warehouse/Scripts/SeedData/web.DisableMeasures.sql). 

Periods **must** be manually enabled to run for all Month, Quarter, Trailing Year and Year periods whose start dates range from the start of the previous year to the current time period each time new historical data is loaded or new measures/initiatives are enabled.  Additionally any trailing year periods should be added that have a period end date of the previous year.  These periods should then be disabled after the historical load is complete to reduce the run time of the nightly job.

###Initiatives
* ACO
* IPP/AQCA

###Measures
 
ACO measures are enabled in all environments, but IPP/ACQA measures are limited by environment to allow for newly created measures to be tested in QA before being promoted to higher environments.

##Customization 

###Patient List  

Procedure on Git: [dbo.PopulatePatientLists](https://github.com/arcadia/qdw-ahp/blob/master/Database/Warehouse/Schema%20Objects/Schemas/rpt/Programmability/PopulatePatientLists.sql) 

The stored procedure generates a "Contracted Provider List with Active Patients" for all sites active in the environment.    

**Specification**  

* Only include persons who are functionally assigned to a provider participating in the program or functionally assigned to 'unassigned provider.'  
(This provider list is currently manually maintained in the sproc, but we are building a connector to automate this in the future)
* Only include patients with a pat_status = 'active'
* Exclude any persons associated with a patient who has a death date in any clinical source

**User Management**  

Currently all patient lists have to be assigned to users manually, though if the patient list is shared with the user admin for a given organization that user can disseminate to the remaining users in their group.  The planned future state is to automatically assign patient lists to users based on each user's location configureation.

###Measure Weights and Thresholds for IPP/ACQA Measures

The measure thresholds for all IPP/ACQA measures are given to us by Excellus and need to be configured within the product for each calendar year.  The thresholds are used universally for all practices and they are confired in this [script](https://github.com/arcadia/qdw-ahp/blob/master/Database/Warehouse/Scripts/SeedData/IPPMeasureThresholds.sql).

On the other hand, measure weights are practice specific and are the result of a negotiation between Excellus and the practices.  However, other than URMC, currently all AHP practices have the same measure weights and one script can be used to assign measure weights to all those practices as shown [here](https://github.com/arcadia/qdw-excellus/blob/master/Database/Warehouse/Scripts/SeedData/Measure_Weights_AHPCommunity.sql).  

###Replication Database 

Certain individuals from AHP have access to a replication of AHP PRD on AHPSQLPRD01.  This replication includes the web and warehouse databases.
