###Purpose
**Front-end Plan Attribution**  
Currently the product only displays persons who are both have clinical records to clinical front-end users. This is problematic for CHPW since members who are assigned to clinics may not always have clinical records at the site. This leads to artificially inflated measure numbers due to reduced denominators for site’s patient population. 

**R1264 Extract:**  
The roster serves as an alternate source to the standard assignment extract and is deemed as more reliable by the client.

##Operations

###Loading the Extracts:
The Extract will be picked by the Informatica job on arrival and loaded into a staging synonym **[staging].[planSupplementRoster]** on arrival. The target Warehouse table for the synonym is rpt.planSupplementRoster

New diles will be available at the source on the 15th of every month but the Informatica task flow should run weekly. 
###Execute Procedure:
The Informatica task flow will kick off rpt.uspDeletePlanRosterSupplement before the load which will delete all existing entries from the table. Informatica should be set up such that the load does not begin until the procedure completes it execution.

**rpt.uspDeletePlanRosterSupplement**  
Procedure to delete all entries from rpt.planSupplementRoster. Will not be scheduled and to be executed by the Informatica task flow.
