##Data Source

The source of data for this connector is a flat file or set of flat files loaded directly into staging from **\\qdwsftp01\0158-HONEVAL_SFTP_PRD**.  Currently direct feeds are only loaded into the highest environment that the connector has been promoted to, i.e. a connector that has been promoted to PRD will not have current data in QA and UAT, but a process is currently being tested to keep QA, UAT and PRD in sync.
